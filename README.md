DOWNLOAD THE FILE NAMED "mostari-css.css"

# mostari-css-01.github.io
This is my first css framework or boilerplate (or whatever) ever (mostari-css). just download the file and use it (till I make a CDN link).
it includes a reset with some basic styling to be used as it is (no classes). and some classes that could make the experience even better.
